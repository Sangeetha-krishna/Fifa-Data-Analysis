# Fifa-Data-Analysis
First, it loads the dataset and extracts the 'Preferred Foot' column, which indicates whether a player primarily uses their left or right foot. Using the `value_counts()` function, the code counts the occurrences of each foot preference (Left and Right). It then identifies which foot is most preferred by determining the value with the highest count. The code prints this information, displaying the most preferred foot and the number of players who prefer it.

In addition to this, the code generates a bar chart to visually represent the distribution of foot preference among the players. The bar chart displays the number of players who prefer their left foot versus their right foot. The chart is styled with sky blue and orange colors, with grid lines for better readability, and labeled with appropriate titles and axis labels to make the chart easy to understand. This allows for a quick visual interpretation of which foot is more commonly preferred by the players in the dataset.
